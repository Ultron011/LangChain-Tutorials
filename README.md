# LangChain Tutorials

A comprehensive collection of LangChain tutorials covering various aspects of building AI applications. This repository demonstrates practical implementations and patterns using the LangChain framework.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### 01 - MODELS
Core model implementations covering the fundamental building blocks of LangChain applications.

- **LLMs** - Basic large language model implementations using OpenAI GPT models
- **ChatModels** - Conversational AI implementations across multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, HuggingFace)
- **EmbeddedModels** - Text embedding examples for semantic search and document similarity

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- API keys for respective providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, HuggingFace)

### Installation
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-openai langchain-anthropic langchain-google-genai langchain-huggingface python-dotenv scikit-learn numpy
```

## üîß What You'll Learn

- **Model Integration** - Connect with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, HuggingFace)
- **Text Embeddings** - Generate and compare text embeddings for semantic search
- **Local vs Cloud** - Both API-based and locally hosted model implementations
- **Document Similarity** - Calculate similarity scores between documents and queries

## üìö Tutorial Progression

Each folder builds upon previous concepts, starting with basic model usage and progressing to more advanced implementations. Navigate through folders sequentially for the best learning experience.

## üîÑ Continuous Updates
