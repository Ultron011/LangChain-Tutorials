# LangChain Tutorials

A comprehensive collection of LangChain tutorials covering various aspects of building AI applications. This repository demonstrates practical implementations and design patterns using the LangChain framework.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### 01 - MODELS
Foundation models and their implementations in LangChain.

- **LLMs** - Basic large language model implementations using OpenAI GPT models
- **ChatModels** - Conversational AI implementations across multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, HuggingFace)
- **EmbeddedModels** - Text embedding examples for semantic search and document similarity

### 02 - PROMPTS
Prompt engineering and template management for better AI interactions.

- **Chat Templates** - Structured prompt templates for conversational models
- **Message Handling** - System, human, and AI message management
- **Interactive Chatbots** - Building conversational interfaces with memory

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- API keys for respective providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, HuggingFace)

### Installation
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-openai langchain-anthropic langchain-google-genai langchain-huggingface python-dotenv scikit-learn numpy
```

## üîß What You'll Learn

**Models & Integration**
- Connect with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, HuggingFace)
- Implement both API-based and locally hosted models
- Generate and compare text embeddings for semantic search

**Prompt Engineering**
- Design effective prompt templates for different use cases
- Manage conversation history and context
- Build interactive chatbot interfaces

**Best Practices**
- Structure LangChain applications for scalability
- Handle different message types and conversation flows
- Implement document similarity and semantic search

## üìö Tutorial Progression

The tutorials are organized in a logical learning sequence:

1. **Models** - Start with basic model integration and usage patterns
2. **Prompts** - Learn effective prompt engineering and conversation management
3. **Advanced Topics** - (More sections coming soon...)

Each section contains practical examples that build upon previous concepts. Follow the numbered folders for the optimal learning experience.

## üîÑ Continuous Updates

This repository is actively maintained and updated with new tutorials and examples. Each commit adds new functionality while maintaining existing examples for reference.
