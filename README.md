### 02 - PROMPTS
Prompt engineering and template management for better AI interactions.

- **Chat Templates** - Structured prompt templates for conversational models
- **Message Handling** - System, human, and AI message management
- **Interactive Chatbots** - Building conversational interfaces with memory

### 03 - STRUCTURED OUTPUT
Generate structured data from language models with schema validation.

- **Pydantic Models** - Define and validate structured output schemas
- **TypedDict** - Use Python type hints for output structure
- **JSON Schema** - Schema-based structured output generation

### 04 - OUTPUT PARSERS
Parse and format model outputs into specific data structures.

- **String Parsers** - Basic text output parsing
- **Pydantic Parsers** - Structured output parsing with validation
- **JSON Parsers** - JSON format output handling

### 05 - CHAINS
Build complex workflows by connecting multiple components.

- **Simple Chains** - Basic prompt-model-parser chains
- **Sequential Chains** - Multi-step processing workflows
- **Parallel Chains** - Concurrent execution patterns
- **Conditional Chains** - Logic-based chain branching

### 06 - RUNNABLES
Low-level building blocks for creating custom LangChain components.

- **Runnable Sequences** - Chain multiple operations together
- **Runnable Parallel** - Execute operations concurrently
- **Runnable Lambda** - Custom function integration
- **Runnable Passthrough** - Data flow control patterns
