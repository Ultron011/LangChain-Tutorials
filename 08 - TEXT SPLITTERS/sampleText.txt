Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Therondale, Princess Elira held the last ember of dragonfire in a crystal vial. The war with the Stone Giants had drained her kingdom’s magic, and only this tiny spark could save them.

“You must take it to the Peak of the Forgotten,” the old mage croaked. “Only there can it be reborn.”

Suddenly, the scene flickers—

A bar in downtown Tokyo, 2079. Neon signs flicker outside the window as detective Riko Narushima scrolls through a holographic display. She’s tracking a hacker known only as Spindle.

“AI ghosts don’t just vanish, captain,” she mutters into her neural link. “Spindle’s in the mainframe. Again.”

She lifts her glass—only for a sword to clang against it.

Somewhere in the Wild West.

Dust storms roll across the Badlands. Sheriff Hank reloads his silver revolver and spits tobacco onto the cracked earth.

“Bandits took the solar core, again?” he grunts. “Damn fools keep mixin’ old tech with old trouble.”

Behind him, a steam-powered mechanical horse whinnies.

Meanwhile, in Space Colony G-9:

Commander Ziya stares at the glowing orb hovering above the artifact chamber.

“This isn’t a power source,” she whispers, eyes wide. “It’s... alive.”

Alarms blare. Alien runes pulse.

Back in Therondale, Elira climbs the icy cliffs of the Forgotten Peak, now with a cybernetic owl on her shoulder and a revolver slung at her side. The sky above twists into a galaxy of neon and storm.

“This is not how legends are written,” she says.

A dragon bursts through a dimensional rift, pursued by Sheriff Hank and a hovercraft piloted by Riko.

End? Or to be continued across timelines, taverns, terminals, and thrones...
