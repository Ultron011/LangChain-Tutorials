result = structured_model.invoke("""The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is a powerhouse flagship that delivers on almost every front. Its camera system is incredibly versatile, capturing crisp and detailed photos in both bright and low-light conditions. The 200MP main sensor is especially impressive, making it one of the best smartphone cameras available. The 6.8-inch AMOLED display is vibrant, sharp, and super smooth with its 120Hz refresh rate. Performance-wise, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip ensures that everything from gaming to multitasking is lightning fast. Battery life easily lasts a full day, and the charging speed is decent, though not industry-leading. One of the standout features is the AI integration for real-time translation and photo editing, which genuinely adds value. The build quality is premium with a sleek, sturdy design. However, the phone is quite bulky and definitely not budget-friendly. Overall, itâ€™s a top-tier device meant for those who want the absolute best Android experience """)
