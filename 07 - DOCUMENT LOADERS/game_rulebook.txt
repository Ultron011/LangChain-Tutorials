     - Use an Action Card.
     - Rest (skip turn to draw 2 Action Cards instead of 1 next turn).
     - Engage another player in a Duel (only if adjacent on Trial Path).

3. **Roll Phase**:
   - If attempting a Trial or a Duel, roll the Fate Die.
   - Trials have a difficulty (e.g., ‚ÄúRoll 4 or higher to succeed‚Äù).
   - Modifiers from cards or Champion Abilities apply.

4. **Resolution Phase**:
   - If Trial is successful: gain Valor Points as listed.

Each Trial Card has:
- A **Name** (e.g., ‚ÄúRiddle of Flames‚Äù)
- A **Difficulty** (number to roll or exceed)
