The gentle hum of the city faded as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the quiet streets. A cool breeze rustled the leaves, carrying with it the distant laughter of children playing in a nearby park. Streetlights flickered to life, illuminating the sidewalks with a soft, golden glow. In the midst of this tranquil evening, a sense of calm settled over the neighborhood, promising a peaceful night ahead.
